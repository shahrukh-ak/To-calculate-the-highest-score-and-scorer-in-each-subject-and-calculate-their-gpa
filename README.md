# To-calculate-the-highest-score-and-scorer-in-each-subject-and-calculate-their-gpa
Write a registrar.py program that will load the records.txt (available in Blackboard) file that has students’ scores in different subjects. The program will perform the following tasks:<br>
- Display the grades in different subjects for each student. You may consider this grading scale:<br>
A >= 90, 89 >= B >= 80, 79 >= C >= 70, 69 >= D >= 60, and 59 >= F<br>
- Display the highest score and scorer in each subject <br>
- Display the GPA of each student. The credit hours for each course is 3 and grade points for A, B, C, D, and F are 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively.<br>
